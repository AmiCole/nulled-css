# nulled-css

Repository containing the custom CSS used on nulled.red, an instance on the fediverse.

Changes include changing the "TOOT!" button to something better, changing the stars to hearts, removes the useless "0" and "1+" number next to the reply button, changing the emoji picker icon, and more to come.
